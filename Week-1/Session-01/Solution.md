## Session 1 - Solution

**1. What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?**
A protocol stack is a set of layers that is used for communication in a network of computers.
It has 4 layers:
1. The Link Layer - Ethernet and Wireless LAN
2. Network Layer - IPv4, IPv6
3. Transport Layer - TCP (Transmission control protocol) and UDP
4. Application Layer - HTTP, DNS, TLS

**2. What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?**
There are mainly four types of web servers – Apache, IIS, Nginx and LiteSpeed.
### Apache Web Server

The Apache Software Foundation developed the Apache web server, which is a highly popular open source web server. It supports a wide range of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Unix FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and more. Apache is used on approximately 60% of all machines that run web servers.

One of the key benefits of Apache is its modular structure, which makes it easy to customize. This means that you can add your own modules to the server to meet your specific requirements. Additionally, Apache is highly stable and easy to administer, making it a reliable choice for web hosting. It can also be successfully installed on multiple platforms.

The latest versions of Apache offer improved flexibility and the ability to handle more requests than earlier versions. This makes it a great choice for high-traffic websites and web applications.

### IIS Web Server

A Microsoft product, IIS is a server that offers all the features such as Apache. Since it’s not an open source, adding personal modules as well as modifying becomes a bit difficult.

It supports all the platforms that run Windows operating system. Additionally, you also get good customer support, if there is any issue.

### Nginx Web Server

Nginx is the next open source web server after Apache. It comprises of IMAP/POP3 proxy server. The significant features offered by Nginx are high performance, stability, simple configuration and low resource usage.

No threads are used to handle the requests by Nginx, instead a highly scalable event-driven architecture that uses small and predictable amount of memory under load is utilized. It has become popular recently and hosts about 7.5% of all the domains globally. Many web hosting companies have started using this server.

### LiteSpeed Web Server

LiteSpeed (LSWS) is a commercial web server that offers high performance and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Apache. It is currently the fourth most popular web server on the internet.

Upgrading to LSWS can lead to improved performance while keeping operating costs low. The server is compatible with common Apache features like .htaccess, mod_rewrite, and mod_security.

LSWS can load Apache configuration files directly and can replace Apache without downtime in just 15 minutes. It can replace all Apache functions, simplifying the transition and making it easy to use. Other front-end proxy solutions cannot do this.

**3. What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?**
The different kind of web hosting are:
1. Shared Hosting - Multiple websites are hosted on a single server. Lower performance.
2. Cloud Hosting - In cloud hosting a website is hosted in a cloud server, where the server can be scaled independently. High availability.
3. Managed Hosting - In managed hosting, a company handles the maintenance and setup of the server and a client can host their website in this server without worrying about maintaining it.
4. VPS - VPS stands for Virtual Private Server. It uses virtualisation to provide a dedicated private storage space on a shared server.
5. Dedicated Hosting - This is a type of hosting in which a complete physical server is dedicated to one client.

**4. What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?**
Scaling is when the capacity of a web application is increased due to increase in traffic or increase in requirement for computational power. Scaling is important for a web application because if servers are not scaled to manage higher traffic, they will go downand the web application will stop working.

Vertical scaling adds resources to a single server (e.g., RAM, CPU, storage) but can be limited by the physical constraints of the server. Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to distribute traffic through load balancing, providing more scalability and fault tolerance, but can be more complex to manage and requires additional resources like load balancers.

**5. What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?**
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is about optimising a website to rank higher on search engine results pages. There are two main types: on-page optimization and off-page optimisation. On-page optimisation involves optimizing your website's content and HTML code for targeted keywords, while off-page optimisation involves link building and social media marketing to improve your website's authority and popularity.

To improve a website's SEO, a developer should use relevant keywords, write unique and valuable content, optimize your metadata, and build high-quality backlinks. Social media can also be used to increase the website's visibility.
